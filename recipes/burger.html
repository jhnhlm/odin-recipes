<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>a savory sandwich consisting of a grilled or fried patty made from ground meat, typically beef, placed between two halves of a bun and often garnished with various toppings and condiments.</p>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Ground beef patty</li>
    <li>Hamburger bun </li>
    <li>Lettuce</li>
    <li>Tomato slices</li>
    <li>Onion slices</li>
    <li>Pickles</li>
    <li>Cheese</li>
    <li>Ketchup</li>
    <li>Mustard</li>
    <li>Mayonnaise</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat your grill or stovetop pan to medium-high heat.</li>
    <li>Divide the ground beef into equal portions and shape them into patties, ensuring they're slightly larger than the bun diameter to account for shrinkage during cooking.</li>
    <li>Season both sides of each patty generously with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Place the patties onto the preheated grill or pan, and cook them for about 4-5 minutes on one side without pressing down.</li>
    <li>Flip the patties and cook for an additional 4-5 minutes on the other side, allowing them to develop a flavorful crust.</li>
    <li>If desired, add a slice of cheese to each patty during the last minute of cooking, allowing it to melt.</li>
    <li>While the patties cook, lightly toast the hamburger buns on the grill or in a separate pan.</li>
    <li>Once the patties are cooked to your desired doneness (medium-rare, medium, etc.), remove them from the heat and let them rest for a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Assemble your burger by placing a patty on the bottom half of the toasted bun.</li>
    <li>Add lettuce, tomato slices, onion slices, pickles, and any other desired toppings.</li>
    <li>Spread ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise on the top half of the bun.</li>
    <li>Place the top bun over the assembled ingredients.</li>
    <li>Serve your juicy burger immediately and enjoy!</li>
</ol>
